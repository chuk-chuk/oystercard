# Oystercard Challenge

Building a more complex system that is stretching my skills in Ruby, TDD and object-oriented design.

Collaborators: Yulia, Ben, Ryan, Oleg 
## How to:

run `bundle` <br>

This will invoke bundler, the dependency manager, that will look into `Gemfile`, see if any of the gems need to be installed (they may already be installed), install them and save the information about the gems, their versions and dependencies into an automatically generated `Gemfile.lock` <br>

use `Rspec`
